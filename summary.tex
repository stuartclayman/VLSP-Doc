The benefits of the lightweight Integrated Virtual Platform which has
a virtual router and the
basic capabilities of a service component are:
\begin{itemize}
\item it provides a different way to do virtual networks: we can
  create arbitrary topologies using virtual routers 
\item uniform manageability of all types of virtual machines can be
  undertaken in the same environment
\item we can do more evaluations of service management functions by
  not using full VEEs and full services. For example, scalability can
  be evaluated more easily, and it can cover both 
  the dimension of virtual services as well as the dimension of
  virtual networks.
%\item we can do enhanced monitoring evaluations

\end{itemize}
