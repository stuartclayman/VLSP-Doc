I would like to thank the following people for their direct
contributions to VLSP.

Firstly, to Richard Clegg for writing all of the Event Engine, the
Event Scheduler, the Probabilistic Experimental Contol sub-system, as
well as all of the routing parts and the router to router routing
table exchange mechanism. He also spent time with me fighting the
wonders of Java's thread and synchronization mechanisms on the way to
creating virtual networks of 700 routers across 12 servers.

Second, to Lefteris Mamatas who also used the system for much work,
for using the system so heavily, for pushing the system to its limits, and for
extending the system for external experimentation to support his IKMS.
Also to Francesco Tusa and Dario Valocchi for their contributions and
insights when using VLSP for research and experimentation.
