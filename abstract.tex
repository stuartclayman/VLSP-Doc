\begin{abstract}
This document gives an overview of the \emph{VLSP}
framework.
We have designed a  testbed called
the \emph{Very Lightweight Network \& Service Platform} based on this framework.
It uses a set of Virtual Routers and Virtual Network Connections to
create a test  environment which can easily accommodate
 (i) fast setup and teardown of a Virtual Router,
and (ii) fast setup and teardown of a Virtual Connection.
Each Virtual Router can run small programs and service elements. 

\smallskip
The document describes the platform itself and the components in more
detail.
The usage and startup of the platform is presented together with the
configuration options.
